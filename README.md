## Description
It's the game that needs no introduction, yet has no play value whatsoever. It's solved and the result is a draw, if no player makes a mistake.
However, this game is a good place to start programming, and with this project I've tried to propose a minimalist implementation.
I hope this project will be of some interest to novice developers.
